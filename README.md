- How did you get the fuel to float around in this void, decentrelized from every galaxy, tb?
- You see, my fellow friend, when nothing is pulling you back, a little work needs to be done for you to carry your own weight and thrive.
- Your ship isn't that heavy, but still prospering. What's the trick?
- Carrying the right mass.

spread the power of collaboration!
