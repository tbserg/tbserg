- Welcome to my spaceship!  
- How did you get the fuel to float around in this void, decentrelized from every galaxy, tb?
- You see, my fellow friend, when nothing is pulling you back, a little work needs to be done for you to carry your own weight and thrive.
- Your ship isn't that heavy, but still prospering. What's the trick?
- Carrying the right mass.

yeah weight is only created when you have an accelerating mass, but the whole point of the above fable is if you are an alive human being, keep being a useful weight when the lives of billions like you are in motion.

spread the power of collaboration!
